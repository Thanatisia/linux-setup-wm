	Installation
	Setup Window Manager
	(OPTIONAL) Setup xinitrc (if using startx - no display manager)
	(OPTIONAL) Setup .{bash_|zsh_}profile

Installation:
	via Package Manager:
		If your distro is
			Debian-based (via Apt):
				# Install bspwm
					sudo apt-get install bspwm
				# Install sxhkd
					sudo apt-get install sxhkd
	via Manual:
		```
		NOTE:
			- With this method, you might need to install additional dependencies or have missing libraries you need to download seperately
				References: https://askubuntu.com/questions/392718/problems-installing-bspwm
				- Install package [apt-file]
					# This program will find the relevant package for the library
						sudo apt-get install apt-file

					# Update after finding
						sudo apt-file update
						Syntax: apt-file search "library_header_fullname"
						Usage: 
							apt-file search "X11/extensions/Xinerama.h"

						# Install returned package
		```
		# Clone Make and Install bspwm
			git clone https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm.git
			make && sudo make install
		# Clone, Make and Install sxhkd
			git clone https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd.git
			make && sudo make install

Setup Window Manager:
	```
	Steps:
		1. Make Directories [~/.config/bspwm, ~/.config/sxhkd]
		2. Copy bspwmrc and sxhkdrc examples to ~/.config/bspwm and ~/.config/sxhkd
		3. Change permissions of bspwmrc and sxhkdrc to Executable for use
	```
	- Make Directories [~/.config/bspwm, ~/.config/sxhkd]
		mkdir -p ~/.config/bspwm ~/.config/sxhkd
	- Copy bspwmrc and sxhkdrc examples to ~/.config/bspwm and ~/.config/sxhkd
		cp bspwm/examples/bspwmrc ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
		cp sxhkd/examples/background_shell/sxhkdrc ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc
	- Change permissions of bspwmrc and sxhkdrc to Executable for use
		chmod +x ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc
		chmod +x ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc


- (OPTIONAL) Setup xinitrc (if using startx - no display manager)
	```
	The '.xinitrc' dotfile is the X initialization Resource Control file
	- Used alongside startx as a settings file to know what to run when passed

	- Contents to put into .xinitrc:
		- Things to run automatically when 'startx' or 'sx' is ran
	NOTES:
		- Try not to put too many functions here as this file is processed on every startx
			- The more you put, the longer it will take to startup the graphical environment

		- Place functions that requires a one-time startup load (i.e. Networking startup etc.) in
			~/.bash_profile (bash shell profile) or 
			~/.profile (generic shell profile) or
			~/.zsh_profile (ZSH shell profile)
		  to reduce the amount of workload on the startup process

		- Place '&' behind commands in .xinitrc to run them in the background
	
	Syntax: startx ~/.xinitrc {params}
	```
	echo "sxhkd &" \
	"exec bspwm" >> ~/.xinitrc

- (OPTIONAL) Setup .{bash_|zsh_}profile
	```
	The profile files related to the default shell will be executed on first startup
	- i.e. on the first bash/zsh startup after logging in
		- .profile will be ran (general)
		- .bash_profile will be ran (if shell is Bash)
		- .zsh_profile will be ran (if shell is Zsh)
	```
